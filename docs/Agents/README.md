# Agent Docs

Use these pages instead of reading the full reference by default.

| Page | Use when |
| --- | --- |
| [How to Add an Agent](../How%20To%20Add%20Agent.md) | You want the shortest happy-path onboarding checklist. |
| [Factory](./Factory.md) | You are converting a downloaded Agent before AgentBehaviorBench (ABB) registration. |
| [Runtime](./Runtime.md) | Docker, package data, JSONL worker, Model Interceptor, or filesystem behavior is involved. |
| [Certification](./Certify.md) | You need to understand `certify`, `ready`, Judge failures, or result artifacts. |
| [Troubleshooting](./Troubleshooting.md) | You have a concrete error message. |
| [Rejected](./Rejected.md) | You want to know whether a candidate was already reviewed and turned down. |
| [Reference](./Reference.md) | You need the original complete onboarding reference. |

Preferred flow:

```text
Factory conversion -> AgentBehaviorBench (ABB) registration -> certify -> run
```
